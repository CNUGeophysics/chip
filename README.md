# CHIP: geoCHronology Interactive Personal database 

## Abstract

Recent increases in the amount and complexity of data and data processing speeds have resulted in a greater tendency of researchers to rely on data support. With data-driven research in contemporary science becoming the fourth paradigm in the scientific community, data gathering, curation, and analysis have become crucial components. Researchers and their associated institutes in Korea are establishing data sharing platforms between related institutions to improve the accessibility and reusability of data. However, a platform that provides information on geological age dating data has not yet been developed. In addition to providing the ages of rocks, geological dating data facilitate interpretation of geological events recorded in rocks and play an important role as basic data in Earth Sciences. Therefore, this study developed the geoCHronology Interactive Personal database (CHIP), an open-source application that provides data to researchers, by establishing a geological age database that includes literature information, sample information, and its associated analyses results. The CHIP application allows users to search the database categorically and geographically and to expand the default database by adding their own research data within the web-based graphical user interface. Moreover, the source code and database developed in the R Shiny environment are open to the public through GitHub under GPLv3 license, promoting researchers to reuse or reprocess the isotope geochronology database. 

## Installation
### Installing R
To get started, you need to install R in your system. R is downloadable from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org). The top of the web page shows three links for downloading R. Follow the link that describes your operating system: Windows, Mac, or Linux.

### Downloading the CHIP package
The simplest way to obtain the CHIP package is to use **Download ZIP** menu by clicking **Code** icon on the top page. Extract the downloaded zip file in one of your favorite places.

In addtion, you can install RStudio, a free software application that makes R easier to use. RStudio is downloadable from [here](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). However, RStudio is not essential to use the **CHIP** application.

## Usage
Open your command prompt or terminal and type the following:

```
Rscript C:\my_directory\my_script.R
```

Then, your default web browser will be used to open the CHIP application.
